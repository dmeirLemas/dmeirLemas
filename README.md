Hi there! I'm Demir Elmas, a passionate young software developer with a keen interest in backend development and machine learning. Currently, I'm a member of BSDSA (Bocconi Students Data Science Association) where I actively engage in various data science projects and activities.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my studies in Economics, Management and Computer Scinece in University of Bocconi, I love building robust backend systems that can handle large-scale data and implementing machine learning algorithms to derive meaningful insights.
<!--
## Projects

Here are some of my projects that I'm proud of:

### Project 1: E-commerce Backend System

Description: Developed a scalable backend system for an e-commerce platform using Django and PostgreSQL. Implemented features such as user authentication, product management, and order processing.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

Description: Built a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques and trained it on a large dataset of movie reviews. Achieved an accuracy of over 85% in classifying sentiment polarity.

Here are some of the projects I've worked (and I am still workin) on recently:

1. [Stock Risk Predictor] - This algorithm uses neural networks to predict how volatile a stock is by assigning it a score based on if it is going to go up or down.

    Technologies used: [Python, LSTM, ANN]
    Link to the project: [Link](https://github.com/dmeirLemas/Attempt-at-Stock-Risk-Analysis)

2. [Carbon Markets Website] - Here my team and I created a website for a company that sells carbon credits by getting the cheapest bundle and calculates each individual's footprints.

    Technologies used: [Python, React, Javascript. Sanity CMS]
    Link to the project: [Link](https://github.com/Sofro21/carbon-markets/tree/ledio)
## BSDSA Contributions

As a member of BSDSA, I actively contribute to various data science initiatives and collaborate with fellow members on exciting projects. Some of the activities include organizing workshops, hosting guest lectures, and participating in hackathons.
